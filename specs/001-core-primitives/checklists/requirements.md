# Specification Quality Checklist: Core Scheduling Primitives

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The spec references "integer time" and "datetime" in functional requirements (FR-020, FR-021). These describe the *problem domain* (time representation), not implementation choices — the constitution's Design Principles mandate this separation, so it is inherent to what the library does, not how it does it.
- "JSON test fixtures" (FR-026) specifies a data format, not an implementation detail — it is the cross-platform contract format.
- "ASCII representations" (FR-023) specifies a capability the library must provide, not how it is implemented internally.
- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
