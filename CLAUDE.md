## Architecture

{Structural overview of key directories and their single responsibilities. Not a full tree — just enough for the agent to navigate.}

## Domain Context

{For low-familiarity projects only. What domain this project operates in, what makes it unusual, and where the agent should expect its intuitions to be unreliable. Reference Constitution Principle V.}

## Learned Rules

{Project-specific rules discovered during development. Accumulated from retrospectives and debugging sessions. Each rule should be one line.}

## DO NOT

{Short, sharp prohibitions specific to this project.}

## Current Focus

{What the agent should expect to be working on. Updated when features change.}

## Navigation

{Pointers to key spec and documentation files.}
